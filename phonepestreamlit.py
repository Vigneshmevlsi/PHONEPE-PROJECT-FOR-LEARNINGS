        This project marks my **first experience writing code**. Coming from an **accounting background**, I never imagined myself working with Python, data structures, or building dashboards. But over the past 10 days, I committed myself fully to learning, exploring, and understanding the process behind this PhonePe data analysis.

        ###  Technical Journey
        - I collected JSON data from GitHub and used Python libraries like `os`, `pandas`, `sqlite3`, `streamlit`, `json`, and `plotly`.
        - I wrote custom Python code to extract data from individual files and store it in dictionaries with structured column lists.
        - The dataset was organized into **3 main folders**, each with **3 subfolders**, resulting in **9 key files**:
            - `Aggregate_Transaction`, `Aggregate_User`, `Aggregate_Insurance`
            - `Map_Transaction`, `Map_User`, `Map_Insurance`
            - `Top_Transaction`, `Top_User`, `Top_Insurance`
        - I converted all JSON files to CSV, then into SQL tables for structured querying and analysis.
        - I performed multiple comparisons and visualizations to understand performance variations across states, districts, and pincodes.

        ###  Business Case Studies Explored
        - *Decoding Transaction Dynamics on PhonePe*
        - *Device Dominance and User Engagement Analysis*
        - *User Engagement and Growth Strategy*
        - *Transaction Analysis Across States and Districts*
        - *Transaction Analysis for Market Expansion*
        - *Insurance Transactions Analysis*

        ###  Personal Reflection
        I spent **6 to 7 hours daily**, learning from class recordings, GitHub, Copilot, YouTube, Google, and asking questions wherever I could. My only goal was **not to copy-paste blindly**, but to understand what I was buildingâ€”even if just the basics.

        I'm submitting this on the **last day**, and while I know there's more to learn, I feel  little happy and proud**. This project gave me the confidence to believe that I can try something in the software field. Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunityâ€”it made me think, learn, and grow in ways I never expected.

        st.markdown("""
            - From the data, it's clear that states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Telangana are leading in digital transactions. 
            - States like Bihar, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Haryana, and Odisha are showing good growth in recent years.
            - On the other hand, border and northeastern statesâ€”such as Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Ladakh, Daman and Diu, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Sikkimâ€”have lower usage. This might be due to fewer facilities, security concerns, or lack of awareness.
            - The good news is that in the last few quarters of 2024, usage has started to rise in almost all regions. With a little extra effort, this growth can continue.
            - Peer-to-peer transfers, mobile recharges, and merchant payments are doing well in most places.
            - Insurance transactions are still low in border states, showing that people may not know much about them or donâ€™t use them yet.
            - Spread Awareness: Use ads and campaigns to teach people about insurance and digital payments, especially in low-usage areas.
            - Recharge Offers: Give discounts or cashback on mobile recharges to attract more users.
            - Partner with Mobile Brands: Work with phone companies to include or recommend PhonePe as a trusted app for payments.
            - Local Language Campaigns: Use regional languages and local culture to make people feel more comfortable using the app.
